# Dex Pages Rails
This is an app I've written as part of the Dex project.  Originally, it was going to be a microservice that only dealt with Pages.

The scope has increased, but I've kept the name.  This app only persists full web pages, everything else is built of caches over these.  This focus on pags is the reason I've kept that name.  So think of this app as "Dex: Pages Edition (Built on Rails)"
